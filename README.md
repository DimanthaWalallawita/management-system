# Host Application

The Host Application is a key part of the Task Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with a focus on Micro Frontend Architecture, Module Federation, and Lazy Loading.

The goal of this project is to manage the Task Management System efficiently by using a micro frontend approach. This approach allows the application to be broken down into smaller, independent modules that can be developed, tested, deployed, and maintained separately. Each module can be dynamically loaded and federated into the host app using Webpack Module Federation.
